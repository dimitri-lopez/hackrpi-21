We are going to have a central website that we can point people towards. Within
the html for the website, there is an iframe link that calls to where the Dash
code is being run.

* Installation
Following: https://dash.plotly.com/installation
* Dash Deployment
- Following: https://dash.plotly.com/deployment
- Heroku Deployment: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile


Setting up the virtual environment. Adds a list of dependencies and appends them
to [[file:requirements.txt]].
#+begin_src bash
virtualenv venv # creates a virtualenv called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate # uses the virtualenv
pip install dash
pip install plotly
pip install gunicorn
pip install pandas
pip freeze > requirements.txt
#+end_src

We next setup a Heroku app. This is what is going to host the dash code. Within
our html we will provide a link to the Heroku app.

#+begin_src bash
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap # for setting up --classic for snap
sudo snap install --classic heroku   # for installing heroku cli
heroku create # create a heroku app
heroku apps:rename hackrpi-spotify-query
heroku git:remote -a hackrpi-spotify-query
git push heroku main # push repo to heroku
#+end_src

We need to decide on a name first. I am going to use the porque website in the
mean time.
