* Project Details
We created a user interface to generate visualizations describing the music of
Spotify artists. The user inputs an artist and is then able to easily plot
parameters of the music. Some of the parameters include:
- Song duration
- Publication date
- Tempo (beats per minute)
- Energy (perceptual measure of intensity / activity)
- Valence (how positive / negative a song is)

* What We Learned
After struggling to get things deployed, we spent a majority of our time trying
to style things so that they looked half decent. There is still quite a bit of
work to do in this area.

- Working with API's
- Working with keys and tokens
- HTML, CSS, webdevelopment
- Working with Git
- Deploying products
- Managing websites
- Working with data frames
- A little bit of music theory

* Challenges We Ran Into
The majority of the day went surprisingly smoothly until it came to styling the
webpage. After much frustration we got something that looked half decent.

- Styling the website
- Figuring out what services are needed to deploy the web app and website
- Our lack of understanding of Git came back to haunt us
- Parsing messy data
- Edge cases when using the API
* Accomplishments
We got a web app off of the ground in less than a day and got a pretty good
application tacked onto. The tool used here is something that we can definitely
see ourselves using in the future, not only to compare songs by an artists but
also find similar songs by an artist.

We also learned an absolute ton about web development as well as a bunch of
other useful technologies. Interfacing with an API and being able to use the
Dash framework will definitely come in useful in the future.

* Built With
We used the following frameworks / API's / services to get the project running.

- Python
- HTML, CSS
- Spotify Python API
- Heroku
- CPanel
- Dash - Python Framework

* Plans for the Future
We spent a good chunk of time trying to get the styling of the page to behave
nicely. In the future, a good rework of the visual elements are definitely in
place.

Some of the parameters available to the user aren't commonly known. Having a
document with extra information on these parameters would create a more cohesive
product.

In terms of function, adding an option to compare parameters of two different
artists would be interesting. It would also be interesting to compare different
genres. The user would then be able to see things like how the tempo of music
has changed over time for various genres.
